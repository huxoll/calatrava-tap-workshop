Before you can begin the installation you will need to have
accounts for the following two systems:

* A container registry
* The Tanzu Network

## Container registry

You will need a login for a container registry.
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) would be fine, but the
preferred option is the internal Harbor repository at
https://harbor-repo.vmware.com.
If you don't have an account there you can use the self-service
process at
[Harbor as a Service](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/AO/Harbor+as+a+Service)
to obtain one.
The link below will open that page in a new window.

```dashboard:open-url

```

## Tanzu Network

You will also need an account (with an `@vmware.com` or `@pivotal.io` address) on the
[Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).
If you haven't got one already, please sign up for one before
proceeding to the rest of the installation.

```dashboard:open-url
url: https://network.tanzu.vmware.com
```
