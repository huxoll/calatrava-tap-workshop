This workshop guides you through the process of installing Tanzu
Application Platform (TAP) on
[Calatrava](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/VCAF/Project+Calatrava+-+Internal+Hybrid+Cloud).
At the end of the workshop you will have created a Kubernetes
cluster on Calatrava, with TAP installed on it.
You can then download the configuration files so that you can
use that cluster for experimentation and learning.

The workshop should take less than an hour, and will expire after 120
minutes.
When 75% of the time has elapsed the timer at the top right will turn
red and you can click on it to extend the workshop.
