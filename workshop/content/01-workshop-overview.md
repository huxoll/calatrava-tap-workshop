## TAP on Calatrava

This workshop guides you through the process of installing Tanzu
Application Platform (TAP) on
[Calatrava](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/VCAF/Project+Calatrava+-+Internal+Hybrid+Cloud).
At the end of the workshop you will have created a Kubernetes
cluster on Calatrava, with TAP installed on it.
You can then download the configuration files so that you can
use that cluster for experimentation and learning.
