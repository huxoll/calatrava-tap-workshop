Now you have your TAP installation on Calatrava, you are going to
want to use it.

The
[Getting started with the Tanzu Application Platform](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.0/tap/GUID-getting-started.html)
page in the product documentation is an obvious place to start.
It walks you through some of the features of TAP and, in particular,
getting your first app up and running.

The `#tap-assist` Slack channel is your go-to place for questions
and queries about TAP.
For questions about Calatrava it's `#calatrava`.

The
[Engineering Wiki TAP page](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CNA&title=Tanzu+Application+Platform)
contains a wealth of links to other resources.


## Happy TAP-ing!
