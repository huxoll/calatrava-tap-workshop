TAP on Calatrava
================

This workshop takes you through the process of installing
Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) on VMware's internal _Calatrava_
infrastructure.
If you have access to that infrastructure you will create a TAP
installation that you can take away at the end of the workshop and
use for your own purposes.

If you don't have access to Calatrava, the workshop won't be of
immediate use to you, but might give you ideas as to how you
could do something similar in your own context.
